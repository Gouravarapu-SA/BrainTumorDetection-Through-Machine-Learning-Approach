# BrainTumorDetection-Through-Machine-Learning-Approach
presents a machine learning approach utilizing gamma distribution for brain tumor detection and data sample imbalance analysis, including the motivation, objectives, existing system limitations, proposed system advantages, system requirements, system architecture, modules, and references.
PROPOSED SYSTEM

In this paper to extract tumor segmented area author is applying machine learning and gamma distribution technique where machine learning is used to detect segmented area and then apply gamma distribution to detect and remove noisy part such as black lines in segmented region.

The proposed gamma distribution algorithm will analyze each pixel to check variance and if variance greater than give threshold noise is present in segmented image such noise will be remove out. In this paper, an improved orthogonal gamma distribution-based machine-learning approach is used to analyze the under-segments and over-segments of brain tumor regions to automatically detect abnormalities in the ROI.

Further data imbalances due to improper edge matching in the abnormal region is sampled by matching the edge coordinates and sensitivity, and the selectivity parameters are measured using the machine learning algorithm.
